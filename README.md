ElBashiq is a wrapper for C sockets, it's used for simple message transfering and handles network search and destination selection, it's not complete yet,
but I have tested it to transfer data between Mobile phone, Laptop and Raspberry PI, the main intention was to transfer commands to RapsberryPI.

It has been tested on (home router with static IPs reserved by the router):

-Arch Linux (Laptop).

-Android with Android NDK.

-RaspberryPI with Arch Linux.

 It has been tested on .

Supported protocols:

TCP/IP

ToDO:

Add commands handling inside the module itself (It was handled by the received device).

Optimize file sending/receiving (Add checksum and fix file naming).

Add data encryption.

Add Authentication/Authorization.

Add web protocols (HTTPS/HTTP/SSH) support


*ElBashiq is a word used to describe small falcons in Egypt, and was used by the archaeologists to descibe Horus
